The sky is blue, stars shine bright  
Evening falls, the breeze hums a gentle song  
Flowers are smiling, painted in vibrant hues  
The river flows, like a soft melody  
Closing our eyes, dreams reveal new worlds  
The sun shows its beauty as evening arrives  
Fish leap in the water, playing with the waves  
Mountains gently offer kisses, telling stories  
Songs soar like birds in flight  
Our hearts discover a sweet, hidden world
